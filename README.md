# Python-and-Sounds

In this repository i am writing a function that reads an audio file and returns 10 consecutive samples of the file starting from the 50001th sample.

The input to the function is the file name (including the path) and the output should be a numpy array 
containing 10 samples.

I am using MGT/sms-tools from https://github.com/MTG/sms-tools. And there you can find the file sounds so as to test your function.
